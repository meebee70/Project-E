Project E
Alexander Aldridge and Chris Kosbial wrote this code for their grade 12 Computer Science 30 class
Hopefully when it is completed, it will be a two player co-op "Bullet Hell" shooter. The twist
is that the world is "round" (ie bullets, players and whatnot can wrap around like in asteroids),
so the players must dodge the enemies and the bullets that they create.
